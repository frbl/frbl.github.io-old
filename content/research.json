    "description": "HowNutsAreTheDutch (Dutch: HoeGekIsNL) is a national crowdsourcing study designed to investigate multiple continuous mental health dimensions in a sample from the general population (n = 12,503). Its main objective is to create an empirically based representation of mental strengths and vulnerabilities, accounting for (i) dimensionality and heterogeneity, (ii) interactivity between symptoms and strengths, and (iii) intra-individual variability. To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross-sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine-grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time. Measuring both psychiatric symptomatology and mental strengths and resources enables for an investigation of their interactions, which may underlie the wide variety of observed mental states in the population.",

    "description": "Leefplezier (English: 'Joy of Life') is a study that focusses on improving the wellbeing of elderly people in the Netherlands. With the Leefplezier project, we aim to apply an idiographic approach and to assess and provide feedback for each individual in isolation, instead of focussing on the group of elderly as a whole. To do so, researchers from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and University of Groningen (RUG) cooperate with Espria to develop a system for measurement and analysis that provides meaningful and personal feedback.",
